# 🌌 AuraSync
> **The High-Fidelity Spotify Shadow-Daemon**

AuraSync is a premium, silent background engine that bridges your Spotify experience with your local machine and Discord. It automatically builds a local high-quality library of your listening history while broadcasting a state-of-the-art status to your friends.

## 🎨 Zero-Config Visuals
Unlike standard Discord presence apps, AuraSync uses **Dynamic Metadata Injection**.
- **Live Album Art**: Automatically fetches and displays the high-res Spotify artwork on Discord.
- **Animated Ambient Mode**: Open **`http://localhost:3333`** in any browser for a full-screen, glassmorphism visualizer with animated blobs and pulsating art.
- **Interactive Live Wallpaper**: Point any live wallpaper software (like Lively Wallpaper) to the localhost link for a truly interactive, music-reactive desktop experience.

## 💎 The AuraSync Advantage
AuraSync isn't just a status updater; it's a **Freedom Engine**.

- **Unlock Premium Power**: When paired with external plugins (like bypass extensions), AuraSync lets you skip music without limits and play any song on-demand—even on Spotify Free.
- **True Offline Listening**: Every song you play is automatically downloaded to your `library/` folder with full metadata. Whether you lose internet or Spotify goes down, your music stays with you.
- **Invisible Proxy**: Broadcast a high-fidelity Discord presence while keeping your system usage at near-zero.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
