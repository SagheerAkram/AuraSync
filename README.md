## 💎 The Elite Value Proposition
AuraSync isn't just an "add-on"—it's a total re-engineering of your Spotify experience.

- **🔇 Ad-Free Everywhere**: No more interruptions. Advanced **Fidelity Shielding** (Network) and **Continuity Management** (API) ensure your music never stops for a commercial again.
- **🔓 Infinite Skips**: Standard Spotify restricts your freedom. AuraSync Elite gives you **Unlimited Skips** and **Unlimited Continuous Flux**.
- **🎯 Working Seek Bar**: The greyed-out seek bar in the Spotify app is now functional. Use the **Shadow Scrubber** to jump to any part of any song directly inside the app.
- **📥 Master Audio Archive**: Every song you listen to is automatically preserved into a **High-Definition Local Archive** in the **`library/`** folder (`Artist/Album/Song.mp3`).
- **📊 Root Playlist Mirroring**: Your Spotify playlists are automatically mirrored into organized folders at the project root (**`/Playlists/PlaylistName/`**).
- **🛡️ Elite Process Guard**: Advanced multi-instance protection. Automatically terminates old versions to save your system RAM (No more resource leaks).
- **🔍 Instant "Find Song" Search**: Use the **`find_song.bat`** tool to locate any track in your archives (`library` or `Playlists`) in seconds.
